/*
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final
 * sorted array one at a time. It is much less efficient compared to
 * other sorting algorithms like heap sort, merge sort or quick sort.
 * However it has several advantages such as
 * 1. Easy to implement
 * 2. For small set of data it is quite efficient
 * 3. More efficient that other Quadratic complexity algorithms like
 *    Selection sort or bubble sort.
 * 4. It's stable that is it does not change the relative order of
 *    elements with equal keys
 * 5. Works on hand means it can sort the array or list as it receives.
 *
 * It is based on the same idea that people use to sort the playing cards in
 * their hands.
 * the algorithms goes in the manner that we start iterating over the array
 * of elements as soon as we find a unsorted element that is a misplaced
 * element we place it at a sorted position.
 *
 * # Complexities
 *
 * Worst-Case complexity   O(NÂ²)
 * Best-Case complexity    O(N)
