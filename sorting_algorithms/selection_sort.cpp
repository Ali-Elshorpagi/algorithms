/*
 * selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm.
 * Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations,
 * particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.
 * The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items
 * which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and
 * a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
 * Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list.
 * The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order)
 * element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element
 * (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
 * The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of sorting techniques
 * which have better time complexity than selection sort.
 *
 * # Complexities
 *
 * Worst-Case complexity   O(NÂ²)
 * Space complexity        O(1)
